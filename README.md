### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Neo4j-BBC-Good-Foods-app** where I scraped BBC-GoodFoods website for 13000+ food recipes. I also built a Neo4j Graph Database on the scrapped data. I am currently developing a R Shiny app to query the database to assist a cook in exploring and optimizing his time and effort spent while doing what he loves the most.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning graph databases and Cypher query language. I am facinated by the great problem solving capabilities graphQL has over relational database like MySQL. I also like reading about consumer behavioural psycology and ML methods implied in its research. 

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about about my past projects and my experiences dealing with data.

- :sunglasses: Iâ€™m looking for fall internships and full time roles starting from Fall 2020 as an Data Scientist or Data Engineer.
